# Machine Learning and AI with Go

This is material for the 2019 "Machine learning and AI with Go" workshop at GopherCon. The workshop provides an intensive, comprehensive and idiomatic view on training, utilizing, evaluating, and deploying machine learning  and AI models using Go. We believe this class is perfect for anyone wishing to build data-driven applications that produce valuable insights, have reproducible behavior, and can be deployed within modern architectures.

- Instructors 
  - Daniel Whitenack - [website/blog](http://www.datadan.io/), [twitter](https://twitter.com/dwhitena), [github](https://github.com/dwhitena)
  - Mariah Peterson - [twitter](https://twitter.com/captainnobody1), [github](https://github.com/Soypete)
- During the workshop, you will also need to work a bit at the command line. If you are new to the command line or need a refresher, look through [this quick tutorial](https://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything).

*Note: This material has been designed to be taught in a classroom environment at GopherCon. The code is well commented but missing some of the contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in class.*
