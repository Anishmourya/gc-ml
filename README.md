# Machine Learning with Go

This is material for any Go developer, data scientist, analyst, or statistician who wishes to learn how to build robust machine learning (ML) applications in Go. This class provides an intensive, comprehensive and idiomatic view on training, utilizing, evaluating, and deploying machine learning models using Go. We believe this class is perfect for anyone wishing to build data-driven applications that produce valuable insights, have reproducible behavior, and can be deployed within modern architectures.

- During the class, you will also need to work a bit at the command line. If you are new to the command line or need a refresher, look through [this quick tutorial](https://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything).

*Note: This material has been designed to be taught in a classroom environment. The code is well commented but missing some of the contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in class.*

## ML and the ML workflow

This material introduces the basics of machine learning and the workflow that should be used when developing and utilizing machine learning models. Once you are done with this material, you will be exposed to the most commonly used machine learning techniques and you will understand the significance of data profiling, training, evaluation, validation, and inference.

## ML with Go

This material introduces some Go packages and frameworks that will help us implement ML in Go. Once you are done with this material, you will know where to look to find ML-related packages for Go, have some hands-on experience working with these packages, and understand the utility of Go for ML.

## Building a complete Go-based ML workflow

This material walks you through a lab in which you will implement a full ML workflow with Go, from data ingress to training to evaluation to inference. Once you are done with this material, you know how to implement and deploy the stages of the ML workflow in Go (for at least one type of ML model and data), and you will be able to transfer this workflow scaffolding to other problems.
